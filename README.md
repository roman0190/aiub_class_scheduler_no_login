🗓️ AIUB Class Scheduler – Smart Class Routine Generator (https://aiub-class-scheduler-no-login.vercel.app/)

This is a Next.js project bootstrapped with create-next-app.

AIUB Scheduler helps students of American International University – Bangladesh (AIUB) to generate optimal class schedules for open credit semesters by filtering available courses, avoiding time clashes, and prioritizing preferences.

🚀 Features
	•	✅ Smart routine generation for open credit courses
	•	❌ Automatically filters out reserved, canceled, and freshman courses
	•	🧠 Detects and avoids schedule conflicts
	•	⚙️ Sorts schedules based on maximum matched preferences
	•	📤 Export routine as a Word (.docx) file
	•	🌐 Mobile responsive UI with a smooth user experience
	•	🔐 No login required — upload XLSX file securely

🛡️ Security Notice
According to a recent advisory by American International University-Bangladesh (AIUB):

“AIUB strongly advises all users (students, faculty, and staff) to use their AIUB Portal username and password only on official AIUB platforms. If you use your AIUB credentials on any third-party website, application, or service not authorized by AIUB, the university will not be responsible for any resulting security breaches, data loss, or misuse of your personal information. Please safeguard your credentials and avoid sharing them outside AIUB’s official systems.”

Respecting this advisory, login has been removed from the app. You can now securely use the system by simply uploading the official XLSX file of offered courses (downloaded from the AIUB Portal). 
	•	✅ No ID/password required
	•	✅ Nothing stored or shared — runs fully in your browser
